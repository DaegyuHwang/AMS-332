## These are five projects that I have done while studying computational modeling of physiological systems in 2024 spring

 Module 1: Hill equation and autoregulatory gene.
 Module 2: Deterministic & stochastic model of the cro-cI genetic network.
 Module 3: A diffusing autoregulatory gene & A diffusing pair of mutually inhibiting genes.
 Module 4: Hodgkin-Huxley model & Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron model.
 Module 5: Poisson spike trains and basic measure of neural activity &  Perceptron learning
