## These are five projects that I had worked on while studying computational modeling of physiological systems in 2024 spring

#### Module 1-3: Computational Modeling of Cell Physiology
### Module 1: Hill equation and autoregulatory gene
### Module 2: Deterministic & stochastic model of the cro-cI genetic network
### Module 3: A diffusing autoregulatory gene & A diffusing pair of mutually inhibiting genes

##
#### Module 4-5: Computational Modeling of Neurobiology
### Module 4: Hodgkin-Huxley model & Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron model
### Module 5: Poisson spike trains and basic measure of neural activity &  Perceptron learning

These projects were designed around the computational implementation of physiological systems by using MATLAB and use of that implementation to explore the properties of the models.
