### #Hill equation and autoregulatory gene.

This directory contains project guidlines and MATLAB code that simulates the Hill equation and an autoregulatory gene, as well as a PDF file containing the results.

I built an autoregulatory gene model about gene expression and regulation in the simplest form considering the fundamental processes of chemical reactions such as transcription and translation by using ordinary differential equations based on Mass-Action Kinetics.

Simulation analyses using a variety of initial values ​​provided insight into the general dynamics of the time-dependent concentrations of interacting proteins and mRNAs and the existence and significance of equilibrium points in the phase plane.
