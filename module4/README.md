### #Hodgkin-Huxley model & Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron model

I built the Hodgkin-Huxley model & Leaky Integrate-and-Fire(LIF) neuron model. I focused on a single neuron that generates electrical signals and propagates those signals over long distances. The introduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley model can explain that action potentials are generated and propagated through sodium and potassium channels.
