### #A diffusing autoregulatory gene & A diffusing pair of mutually inhibiting genes.

 In Project 1, we implemented a ODE-based model for a simple autoregulatory gene; that is,
 a gene that encodes a protein whose function (or part of whose function) is to activate the
 transcription of itself. Now we are interested in the reaction-diffusion model for this system.

I made a model for a diffusing pair of mutually inhibiting genes considering Fickâ€™s law of diffusion. 
To obtain meaningful results, mathematical models must be consistent with biological knowledge. 
Biological systems have spatial structures and most are mostly spatially heterogeneous. 
Since this affects the flux, flow rate, and concentration change rate for each spatial structure, I created a model that explains these aforementioned biological facts by introducing a Reaction-Diffusion model where concentrations vary in space and time using partial differential equations.
